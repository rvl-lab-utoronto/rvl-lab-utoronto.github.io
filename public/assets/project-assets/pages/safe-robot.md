## **Safety Considerations During Robot Learning and Deployment**

While progress in deep learning and computer vision research has been one of the key enablers of deploying
modern robotics systems in the real world, there is an abundance of research, engineering, and regulatory
challenges currently precluding the certification of these systems as safe for deployment around humans
and other animals. Yet, that has not prevented private companies and other organizations from frequently
deploying and testing (semi-)autonomous robot systems in the wild, among humans who have not necessarily
explicitly consented to being part of such experiments. In order for the public to trust autonomous robots,
these systems need to be able to reason about risk in the face of rare events and how to minimize it.
